While a direct code fix isn't always possible for vague Expo CLI errors, the solution involves systematic debugging and troubleshooting steps to identify and rectify the underlying issue.  This may include:

1. **Updating Expo CLI:** `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. **Updating dependencies:** `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`
3. **Resolving dependency conflicts:** Careful examination of `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`)  to identify and resolve any conflicting dependency versions.
4. **Cleaning the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and the `ios/build` and `android/build` folders, then run `npm install` or `yarn install` again.
5. **Checking project configuration:** Ensure that `app.json` is correctly configured, and that required plugins or dependencies are appropriately specified.
6. **Using a minimal project:**  Start a new, minimal project using `expo init MinimalProject` and testing its operation to see if the problem occurs in a completely isolated environment. 
7. **Community support:** Using forums, issue trackers, or online communities to search for solutions to any lingering errors.
