# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors

This repository demonstrates troubleshooting techniques for vague or unexpected errors encountered when using the Expo CLI.  These errors often arise from issues within Expo's internal processes rather than specific code problems.

## Common Scenarios

* **Vague error messages:**  Expo may provide limited information, making identification challenging.
* **Intermittent failures:**  The error may occur sporadically, making it hard to reproduce.
* **Post-update problems:** Errors can emerge after updating the Expo CLI or project dependencies.

## Debugging Strategies

1. **Check Expo CLI version:** Ensure you're using the latest stable version.
2. **Verify dependencies:**  Check `package.json` for conflicts or outdated packages using `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated`.
3. **Inspect `app.json` and `package.json`:**  Ensure these files are correctly configured and have no typos.
4. **Clean and rebuild:**  Sometimes, a clean build (`expo start --clear`) resolves temporary issues.
5. **Examine logs:** Check the Expo CLI's log output for additional clues.  It might contain hints beyond the primary error message.
6. **Search for similar issues:** Look for reported errors similar to yours on the Expo forums or GitHub issues.
7. **Create a minimal reproducible example:** If possible, create a very simple Expo project to see if the error persists. This helps isolate the cause.

## Example (Conceptual):

The accompanying code files (`expoBug.js` and `expoBugSolution.js`) offer conceptual examples.  The real challenge isn't fixing code within the app, but rather diagnosing why the CLI itself isn't functioning correctly.  It illustrates how to check for proper project setup and identify version mismatch.
